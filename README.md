This is a group assignment and its intent is : A hospital has recently upgraded its system infrastructure to optimize data handling and improve patient monitoring. As part of this upgrade, the hospital requires a system to record heart rate data, archive logs, and securely back them up to a remote server for future access. In this assignment, you will develop three shell scripts to manage these tasks.
